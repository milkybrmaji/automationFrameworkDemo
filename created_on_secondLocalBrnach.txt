I created this file on my local machine in a branch I created on my local machine called "second_local_branch"
I am practicing my github skills
I will push this branch to my remote repository using the git command "git push -u origin second_local_branch"

The dash -u sign in the git command above tells git to establish a tracking connection
the tracking connection allows git to follow the local branch and its related counter part that is in the remote
repository. So when I am pulling and pushing commits, I don't have to specify from where or to where exactly that 
I'm doing that action for.

Example
   Remote Branch  in   Origin/second_local_branch
    - - - - - - -   - - - - - - - - - 
  /               \                  /
 /                  \ Pull request  /
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Local branch 
I can push my branch from my local machine to the remote space allowing other paticipants to contribute to my branch and
show a history of my changes. I can also pull from the remote branch updating my local branch with any new changes anyone
may have added. I can do this all while in my branch that I want to work with without having to specify exactly where I want
to push my code to or pull from.

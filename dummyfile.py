#I've pulled the updated master branch successfully and now my local repository is up to date
#I've added and commited this comment section to my local git repository version control and I'm now going to push it
#but i've also committed new changes to this file from github. I should get an error message when
#trying to push this file into the master branch, and the error message should request that I pull from
#master branch first to get my local repository up to date with the master branch on github. Then I will
#be able to push the new commits from my local repository and merge it with the master branch.
